 #Integers and floats are two different kinds of numerical data. An integer (more commonly called an int) is a number without a decimal point. A float is a floating-point number, which means it is a number that has a decimal place. Floats are used when more precision is needed. 

 
int = 100
float = 100.100

print(f"{int} + {float} = {int + float}")
