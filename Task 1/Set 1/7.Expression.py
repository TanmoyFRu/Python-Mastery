print(5 + 3.0)

#When performing arithmetic operations between an int and a float, Python automatically converts the integer to a float to avoid loss of precision. In this case, 5 is an integer, and 3.0 is a float. When you add them together, Python converts 5 to a float and returns the result as a float. The output of the code snippet is 8.0.
