#In Python, indexing and slicing are techniques used to access specific characters or parts of a string. Indexing means referring to an element of an iterable by its position whereas slicing is a feature that enables accessing parts of the sequence.

# Indexing in Python starts from 0. The first element of a string has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on. You can also use negative indexing, where the last element has an index of -1, the second-to-last element has an index of -2, and so on.

string = "Hello, World!"
print(string[4])  # Output: o
print(string[-1])  # Output: !

# In this code snippet, the string "Hello, World!" is defined. The character at index 4 is accessed using string[4], which is 'o'. The character at index -1 is accessed using string[-1], which is '!'. The output of the code snippet is 'o' and '!'.

# The code snippet demonstrates how to access specific characters in a string using indexing in Python.
